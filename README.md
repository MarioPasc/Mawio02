My name is Mario Pascual. I'm a Medical Engineering student with a minor in Bioinformatics. 

Currently, I'm working on a BSc final project focused on Neuroimaging segmentation using Deep Learning CNN architectures, primarily using [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as my main DL library. ðŸ§ 

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Linux, and Biomedical Imaging.

I'm always open to new experiences, whether it's volunteering or becoming more involved in academic structures.
